# Human-Body-Measurements-DataAnalysis
This repository contains a structured data analysis project using the NHANES 2020 dataset to explore adult body measurements. The project leverages NumPy and Matplotlib to perform statistical analysis, data standardization, visualization, and interpretation of health indicators such as BMI, waist-to-height ratio, and waist-to-hip ratio.
